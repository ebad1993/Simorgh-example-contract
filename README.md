# Simorgh-example-contract
Example of smart contract for Simorgh communication system 


These smart contracts are written using Remix-Ethereum IDE. Here are two contracts. One to send the file from the sender to the authentication node and the other to receive the file by the recipient from the authentication node. 
These contracts use RSA's digital signature. The code written to implement RSA's digital signature can be retrieved at https://github.com/axic/ethereum-rsa.
